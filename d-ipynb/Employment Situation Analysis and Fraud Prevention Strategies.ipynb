    "## Analysis of Employment Situation for University Graduates and Countermeasures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularization of higher education has led to a shift in employment perceptions for most young people. However, the number of available jobs in the open economic market is relatively limited. This has resulted in structural imbalances where the number of graduates (hereafter referred to as university graduates) exceeds the demand. Meanwhile, geopolitical influences and the weak economic growth have exacerbated these structural contradictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the oversupply of graduates, the demand for talent in the corporate market is saturated. This reality has led some graduates to no longer pursue the goal of 'immediate employment after graduation' but to enter a 'waiting and observing' state, giving rise to the concept of 'delayed employment.' This change in mindset partially reflects the uncertainty and competitiveness of today's job market. Graduates have realized that finding an ideal job is not easy, and they are paying more attention to personal development and career planning to secure better employment opportunities."

    "Yang Yong (2023) focuses mainly on the role of positivity but lacks practical suggestions for building a support system that students can rely on when facing difficulties. I believe that it is important to emphasize the expansion of humanities disciplines, which provide a crucial pathway for human cognition and understanding of the world."
