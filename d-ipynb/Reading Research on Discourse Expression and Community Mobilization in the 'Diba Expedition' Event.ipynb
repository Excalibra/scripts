    "The “Emperor Bar's Facebook Expedition” event in 2016 involved a group of youth from a subculture that resists the mainstream. They typically appear to stay away from politics, yet during the “Chou Tzu-yu raising the Taiwan independence flag” incident, members of the Emperor Bar took collective action to raise the flag of patriotism, “fighting against Taiwan independence and maintaining unity.” This event changed people's preconceived notions of online youth groups. This is something I have written about before in [Subculture Perspective Review and Bullet Screen Research](https://nbviewer.org/github/Excalibra/scripts/refs/heads/main/d-ipynb/Subculture%20Perspective%20Review%20and%20Bullet%20Screen%20Research.ipynb) and [Basic Analysis of Timely Commentary on Livelihood News](https://nbviewer.org/github/Excalibra/scripts/refs/heads/main/d-ipynb/Basic%20Analysis%20of%20Timely%20Commentary%20on%20Livelihood%20News.ipynb). This further proves that people have diverse emotional expressions and varied interests. However, the focus of this analysis is — Emperor Bar's discourse expression and community mobilization research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Emperor Bar's Expedition” reflects the differences between Taiwan and China in the context of political education：\n",
    "\n",
    "Taiwan perspective: According to Li Hongmei (2016)[<span id=\"fn3\"><sup>[1]</sup></span>](#fn3-black)Over the past decades, Taiwan's localization movement has led to fewer people identifying as Chinese and more people identifying as Taiwanese. According to poll data released by National Chengchi University in 2014, as much as 23.8% of the Taiwanese population leaned towards or wished for rapid Taiwan independence; 60.4% of the population identified solely as Taiwanese; 32.7% considered themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese, while only 3.5% identified solely as Chinese. The proportion of those inclined towards Taiwan independence and identifying as Taiwanese reached a new high since 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "China perspective: China has carried out extensive promotion and advocacy in the areas of nationalism and patriotic education. At the same time, China's economy is progressing at a high growth rate, which has led to an increasing sense of confidence in identity and national pride among Chinese citizens. Therefore, to some extent, they may mistakenly believe that the lack of identification with China among the Taiwanese population is due to insufficient understanding of mainland China or the influence of elites, media, politicians, and opportunistic proponents of Taiwan independence. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to understand the “Emperor Bar's Expedition” within this context. To gain an in-depth understanding of the motivations of the Emperor Bar community, one must first understand the development process of the community, then analyze the discourse of its members, and identify the core motivations behind their expressions. Only then can the overall logic and essence of the community's mobilization be comprehended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The evolution from Li Yi Bar to the Emperor Bar community\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an analysis of the self-evolution of Li Yi Bar into the current Emperor Bar from both horizontal and vertical perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Stage：** Li Yi Bar was a theme park for fans' idol worship of Li Yi, which was no different from most fan support groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The beginning of “Li Yi Bar” being called “Emperor Bar”：** When the administrators of Li Yi Bar began censoring posts that discussed controversial topics related to Li Yi, some members started to express their opinions using metaphors, allusions, and other forms of creative reinterpretation to avoid censorship. A typical example of this was the widespread circulation of The Chronicle of Emperor Li Yi. As a result, Li Yi Bar began to be referred to as Emperor Bar. From that point on, the transformation of Li Yi Bar into Emperor Bar marked the gradual emergence of a “counter-authority” cultural and ideological awareness within the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The evolution from “Emperor Bar fans,” “D8 fans,” “D-sis,” to the term “diaosi” (losers)：** The term “D-sis” was misread and humorously interpreted by the public as “diaosi” (losers). The opposing communities and anti-fans of Emperor Bar then adopted the term “diaosi” as a derogatory label for Emperor Bar members. The term “diaosi,” due to its prefix “diao,” which carries crude, vulgar, or offensive connotations, became a demeaning term used to show contempt or disdain for others. \n",
    "\n",
        "**The establishment and popularization of the “diaosi” (loser) identity in Emperor Bar：** When the other party lowers the status of \"diaosi\" through self-improvement, \"diaosi\" is shaped into a binary opposition between the lower and higher levels, opposing \"elite\". In this context, people develop a strong resonance with issues such as the wealth gap, cultural divides, and social stratification. The concept of \"diaosi\" has expanded from being a personal reference and imagination to the realm of collective consciousness. [<span id=\"fn1\"><sup>[2]</sup></span>](#fn1-black)。The first wave of Li Yi's fans began to fade, and the continuous expansion of the cultural essence within the 'Emperor Bar' (Diba) is precisely the qualitative factor accelerating the emergence of this phenomenon. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The popularity of the term 'diaosi' has contributed to the collective reflection of livelihood phenomena by the members of the Emperor Bar (Diba)：**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group characteristics: As of 2016, the members primarily consisted of enthusiastic university students or working men, generally under the age of 30. [<span id=\"fn2\"><sup>[3]</sup></span>](#fn2-black)\n",
    "2. Background and attributes of the members: Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, they were influenced by both the culture of their parents and the generational stratification of contemporary society. They developed a consciousness that was anti-tradition, anti-authority, and anti-hierarchy. At that time, they had access to cutting-edge information and communication through internet media, benefited from widespread compulsory education, and university enrollment expansion, fostering a sense of intellectual and moral superiority. Individuals were trapped in dominated lives, feeling powerless in the face of social stratification and its rigidity, which led them to adopt self-deprecation, self-mockery, and resentment toward reality as a way to counteract the contradictions of social reality. This form of resistance was often expressed through cynicism and social satire, in the hope of finding solace within themselves.\n",
    "3. Subculture's reconstruction of mainstream culture: Forms of subcultural expression include the creation and dissemination of unique, new media content by youth groups that are not accepted by traditional mainstream culture. These groups seek their own interests, values, and communities with shared topics. Through the secondary creation that integrates popular memes, film and anime topics, and current events, the enthusiasm for discussion among Emperor Bar (Diba) members has been further amplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, 'Li Yi Bar' (Diba) evolved from its original theme park dedicated to the idolization of Li Yi into a community where members projected subculture to reflect social class phenomena and discuss various topics. This marked a successful metamorphosis of the Diba community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of the Discourse and Memes of Diba Members\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of the Discourse and Behavior Patterns of Diba Members\n",
    "\n",
    "**The discourse within Diba reflects the values and beliefs of ordinary people, while also exhibiting hostility toward officials and the wealthy.** In this discourse, grassroots communities idolize popular figures and refine them as representatives of grassroots heroes and symbols of their own idealism. However, this approach may create binary oppositions, intensify xenophobia and hatred, and even carry the risk of leading to retaliatory violent incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diba members display an unrestrained and cynical demeanor, mocking conventional norms. While they recognize social surface characteristics, they generally lack in-depth analytical thinking about underlying issues, simplifying the complexity of social problems and often employing controversial binary opposition in their discourse.** Regarding party and government news in mainstream media, community netizens often criticize with remarks such as: 'There is no news broadcast where meetings are not grand, closures not successful, speeches not significant, resolutions not passed, applause not enthusiastic, morale not boosted, leaders not attentive, or meetings not cordial.' On views about the world and life, they believe that 'in reality, when you think about it, all the problems in the world can be answered with “none of your business” or “none of my business”.' Regarding public entertainment topics, they often express their frustration with phrases like: 'Celebrities, idols, trends, culture — it's all the same, just two words: 'exploitation' and 'deception.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Members of Diba display characteristics of being full of passion, impulsive in behavior, and having extreme and polarized thinking in their posts and speech. These traits of rebellion manifest in the following aspects：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group Emotionalism**：These acts of rebellion are often led by a group of individuals, sparking the emotions of a large number of participants. These emotions are typically based on subjective personal biases or one-sided perceptions.\n",
    "2. **Irrationality of collective action**：These acts of rebellion lack thorough rational thinking and balanced judgment. Participants often only see one side of the issue, ignoring the complexity and diversity behind it.\n",
    "3. **Individual attacks and insults**：These acts of rebellion are often accompanied by attacks and insults directed at specific individuals or organizations, involving personal attacks and derogatory language, rather than being based on factual and rational discussion.\n",
    "4. **Group effect and collective psychology**：These acts of rebellion are often rapidly spread and amplified through platforms like social media, creating a group effect and collective psychology that makes participants more likely to follow the trend rather than think independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Diba collective carries a high risk of rebellion, a risk that was typically demonstrated in movements like the attacks on Facebook, the Li Yuchun Bar, and the Dong Bang Shin Ki Bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discourse characteristics of women participating in Diba's campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "Women, driven by maternal instincts of care and affinity, are generally better at experiencing and understanding their own and others' emotions compared to men. This aspect became apparent after the female 'little pink' group joined, as Diba's campaigns, which initially exhibited 'patriarchal hegemony,' began to reflect this shift.[<span id=\"fn1\">(Li Hongmei, 2016, P108)</span>](#fn1-black)In the mid-stage, it began to exhibit a rhetoric centered on 'love,' expressed through persuasive discourse, which became clearly evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I just feel so sorry for Taiwan, being deceived like this. Have they ever studied history?”<br/>\n",
    "“Taiwan, the motherland loves you”<br/>\n",
    "“I don’t talk about politics, and I don’t have any grand theories. I just want to share some of my experiences. I am a Taobao store owner. When dealing with my Taiwanese compatriots, I always give them the biggest discounts and the most sincere advice.... I hope all Taiwanese compatriots can rationally consider the idea of coming home. A home, no matter how separated, can never truly be divided.”<br/>\n",
    "“Taiwanese friends, let me teach you to sing the national anthem: Rise, people who refuse to be slaves, sing!” “Auntie Tsai, would you like to buy a face mask? I’ll give you a 50% discount!!!” “President Tsai, Taiwanese friends, have you ever considered how powerful we could be if the Chinese nation united?”<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yan Changkun[<span id=\"fn2\">(2018,P40)</span>](#fn2-black)believes: These affable, lyrical political discourses are close to everyday life and tangible reality, making it easier to gain others' approval and feedback. This also served as the foundation for later cross-strait exchanges between netizens. However, some characteristics of these discourses show a tendency for potential ideological implantation and soft brainwashing. Below is an analysis of the discourse features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Biased Speech**：Some statements express sympathy or pity for Taiwan, as well as love for the motherland. Such emotional expressions may resonate with the audience, shaping their inclination toward specific viewpoints.\n",
    "2. **Skillful Usage**：Certain statements use skillful methods of expression, such as claiming not to understand politics but sharing personal experiences, or calling on Taiwanese compatriots to rationally view reunification through discounts and sincere advice. This approach may influence the audience’s attitude through affinity and emotional resonance.\n",
    "3. **Emphasis on National Identity**：Some statements emphasize national identity, such as teaching the national anthem or using phrases like \"the motherland loves you.\" This expression may aim to strengthen the audience's emotional connection to national identity and further shape their ideology.\n",
    "4. **Economic Incentives**：One statement mentions giving Aunt Cai a discount on face masks. This kind of economic inducement may aim to reinforce pro-China sentiment through commercial transactions and increase the audience's acceptance of reunification perspectives.\n",
    "5. **Temporary Discomfort and Cringe in Language**：These statements convey strong emotions and sentiments, sometimes containing elements of manipulation and incitement. Such language tends to influence emotions and attitudes, steering stances. Occasionally, when we perceive excessive emotionality and strong bias in speech, we may experience discomfort and a feeling of cringeworthiness. This reaction may stem from an alert and protective mechanism against potentially manipulative and emotionally charged rhetoric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above characteristics, these feminine statements largely rely on affinity, emotional resonance, and economic inducements to foster emotional identification and shifts in stance, containing a certain ideological inclination and embedded purpose. However, personal views and positions may vary due to different backgrounds and beliefs. Therefore, it is important to maintain critical thinking and embrace a diversity of opinions when addressing these statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Semantic Reconstruction of Memes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the explanation and elaboration refer to the use of memes as discussed by Yan Changkun[<span id=\"fn2\">(2018,P49,P55)</span>](#fn2-black)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Excalibra/scripts/refs/heads/main/AQUICK/Examples%20of%20the%20Use%20of%20Symbols%20and%20Slang%20(cn).png\"  width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\" />\n",

    "\n",

    "The mechanism of memes can be analyzed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Structure of Memes**：The first layer of a meme conveys the first impression of emotion through the characters' actions and expressions. The second layer consists of text, which, when combined with the characters' actions and expressions from the first layer, generates multiple visual and informational elements, allowing for diverse interpretations of the meme. Exaggerated character actions and expressions, paired with serious text, create a bizarre and absurd overall content, resulting in a humorous effect that is both entertaining and reconstructible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Entertainment and Meaning Reconstruction**：When the entertainment elements of an information medium outweigh the direct serious text, the focus of information transmission shifts, and people are more likely to engage with and enjoy the entertaining content. Therefore, memes, as carriers of entertainment elements, have become an important way of communicating information. As a medium for social activities involving mutual entertainment, memes carry an entertainment nature and contribute to the reconstruction of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identity Reconstruction in Virtual Spaces**：By using memes for visual rhetoric in virtual spaces, individuals display their identities in specific ways, thereby reshaping the interactions with others. Through crafting specific images and roles, individuals impose discipline or influence on others, while simultaneously shaping new social norms and expectations in these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through their internal structure, information entertainment and meaning reconstruction, and identity reconstruction in virtual spaces, memes have become a rich and diversified communication tool capable of conveying emotions, entertaining people, and reshaping the way individuals interact with society.\n",

    "## Research on the Mobilization of the Emperor Bar Community\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cultural Model of the Emperor Bar Community (Framework Cognition)\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of collective memory was first introduced by French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs in the 1920s. It refers to the various memories preserved by a collective, including various cognitions about the collective's past, encompassing changes in material objects, practices, knowledge, emotions, and other aspects. For social individuals, their personal experiences, thoughts, emotional experiences, and expressions can all become part of their memory. From a broader societal perspective, the memories of countless individuals, from different angles, scopes, and levels, come together, permeate, and merge, thus forming a macro-level social memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation and evolution of collective memory are fundamental to social communities and group identity. It can be a shared memory of specific social groups, cultural organizations, ethnic communities, or nations, built and maintained through common history, culture, values, and symbolic elements. Collective memory is not only an extension and expansion of individual memory but also reflects the group's sense of identity and cohesion, playing a crucial role in shaping group identity, historical cognition, and social consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current generation of Emperor Bar (DiBa) youth netizens, a unique group ranging from those born in the 1980s to the 1990s, naturally have their collective memory embedded within the broader social memory. Their social cognitive cultural maps and social psychological spectra are, to some extent, shaped by this collective memory. However, due to the limited space that individuals can extend into, the social memory of Emperor Bar netizens, who have spent a long time navigating social forums, is largely derived from the events that occur online. It is shaped through processes such as smoothing, sharpening, adding, and the constructions and imaginations that are filtered and overseen by traditional mainstream media and opinion leaders. Ultimately, this process forms the cultural model of discourse production from Emperor Bar that we experience today.（[<span id=\"fn2\">Yan Changkun,2018, p. 58 and Figure 8</span>](#fn2-black)）\n",

    "### Collective Action of “Emperor Bar's Expedition” Triggered by Traumatic Collective Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues of Taiwan, Tibet, the Diaoyu Islands, and the South China Sea are matters that, to any Chinese citizen with a basic understanding of politics, are considered non-negotiable. When Chou Tzu-yu raised the “Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth” flag and claimed that she was not Chinese but Taiwanese, it once again struck at the complicated nationalist and patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people. Under the weight of collective traumatic memory, it became clear that the pro-independence stance of Taiwan was unacceptable to mainland youth who had long been taught that “Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of China.” Once this event spread, it became an important source of the surge in online nationalism. Through the propagation by Emperor Bar, it played a role in arousing patriotic sentiments, turning a group of populists influenced by Emperor Bar into nationalists. This led to the first large-scale collective “Great Wall-breaking” expedition in the history of mainland China's internet. （[<span id=\"fn2\">Yan Changkun, 2018, p. 58 and Figure 10</span>](#fn2-black)）\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Excalibra/scripts/refs/heads/main/AQUICK/Figure%2010%3A%20Diagram%20of%20Traumatic%20Memory%20Triggering%20Nationalism%2C%20Patriotism%2C%20and%20Action.png\" width=\"45%\" height=\"45%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition and cooperation between nationalism and patriotic sentiment can be understood as a relationship in which they interact and intertwine to some extent. Nationalism emphasizes identification with and loyalty to one's nation, striving to protect national interests, while patriotic sentiment refers to love and concern for the country. When a nation faces challenges or threats, nationalist emotions can ignite patriotic feelings, making people more united and motivated to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must also recognize that nationalism can be misused in certain situations: as an ideology, if manipulated by rulers or specific groups, nationalism may be used to exclude or marginalize other groups, suppress diversity, limit the plurality of opinions, and justify discrimination or aggressive behavior toward others. In such cases, nationalism becomes a tool of fascism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mobilization Organizational Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of stimulation and motivational effect in society is particularly evident in certain situations. In emotionally charged gatherings, we are able to experience feelings that are normally absent and achieve things that individual strength alone cannot accomplish. ... For this reason, all groups—whether political, economic, or religious—never forget to hold regular meetings, because through collective displays of shared beliefs in these gatherings, group members can reinforce their common convictions. To strengthen certain emotions that are easily dissipated when alone, the only thing that must be done is to bring together all those who share these emotions in closer, more dynamic relationships. Here, Durkheim specifically emphasizes the particular social functions or effects that public opinion or strong collective emotions can have, meaning their significance cannot simply be dismissed as “irrational.” Furthermore, Durkheim argues that the creation of a collective fervor is not limited to clan festivals in primitive societies but applies to “all political, economic, and religious groups,” which, to maintain internal cohesion and strengthen the beliefs of group members, must regularly hold gatherings. ———— Mobility of the Mob: The Social Psychological Foundations of Internet Riots [<span id=\"fn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></span>](#fn4-black)\n",

    "#### Multi-Platform Netizens and the Discourse Union of the Emperor Bar Community\n",
    "\n",
    "The participants in the expedition, aside from the original “Yi Si” members of Emperor Bar, were mostly temporarily mobilized and recruited from other social platforms. During the initial mobilization, there were two main QQ groups and six sub-teams under the frontline troops. One team was responsible for collecting materials and images related to “Taiwan independence,” the second team was tasked with mobilizing netizens across various platforms, the third team handled logistics, including creating anti-“Taiwan independence” memes and statements, the fourth team, mostly composed of overseas students and expatriates, was responsible for translating relevant texts, the fifth team specialized in managing Facebook likes and reports, and the last team focused on Cantonese-related tasks.（[<span id=\"fn2\">Yan Changkun, 2018, p. 58</span>](#fn2-black)）\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grassroots Opinion Leader Mobilization and Call to Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinion leaders are individuals with special influence who can shape the opinions of others. However, grassroots opinion leaders and their audiences can also be seen as a kind of affinity group or organization. In a group where there is a consensus on basic values and a strong emotional bond, opinion leaders are more likely to encourage their followers to accept and align with their viewpoints, creating a strong emotional resonance. Followers will actively spread and share the opinion leader's perspectives, forming a chain of information dissemination. This connection helps the opinion leader's views and information spread rapidly across the internet, influencing more people, thus providing the foundational momentum for the subsequent outbreak of public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinion leaders, through their interaction with and appeals to followers, can mobilize them to participate in collective actions, such as petition drives, online protests, and more. Under the guidance of opinion leaders, followers are more likely to unite and collectively express and defend specific viewpoints, rights, or interests. Therefore, the connection between opinion leaders and their followers is a crucial pathway and foundational mechanism for the emergence and evolution of online public opinion.\n",

    "\n",
    "The national territory and totems go without saying; the following briefly explains the role of celebrities as memes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase entertainment value and appeal: Celebrities, as objects of public attention, have a broad influence and a large fan base. Using celebrity memes can enhance the entertainment value and appeal of a mobilization effort, attracting more people to participate and pay attention.\n",
    "2. Establish emotional connection: Celebrities, as beloved public figures, can create emotional resonance with the public through their image and expressions. Using celebrity memes can trigger people’s affection and emotional connection to the celebrity, which in turn transfers these emotions to the mobilization effort, enhancing people's willingness to identify with and participate in collective actions. \n",
    "3. Strong expressive effect: Celebrity memes often feature distinctive expressions and characteristics, allowing for a more accurate expression of emotions and attitudes. Using celebrity memes in mobilization efforts can directly convey information and emotions through visual imagery, enhancing the expressive effect and making the message more vivid, easier to understand, and more shareable. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an important mobilization resource, visual texts or symbolic visuals often appear in the form of maps, national totems, and the personal images of leaders. These serve to gain collective identity and the concept of territorial boundaries, thereby facilitating mobilization efforts and maximizing nationalism through visual communication.\n",

    "Gustave Le Bon provides a more detailed analysis of suggestive discourse. From a psychoanalytic perspective, he believes that group rules are formed through collective illusion mechanisms, arguing that groups are often in a state of anticipation and are therefore easily influenced. Once a suggestive cue is given, and after a process of contagion, group tendencies will quickly align in unison. Therefore, the group-style discourse formed by Emperor Bar, as a form of suggestive power, can mobilize group emotions. In this process, it is important to see if the symbolic cues given by the community are precise and effective. A good example of this is the metaphor used before the Emperor Bar “expedition” —the “King Bar” mobilization image featuring the Spartan 300 warriors, which invoked the emotions and memory of beliefs among Emperor Bar members, generating the power to take action.

    "We can pay attention to the following aspects to observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Emotional stimulation: These types of texts often use emotional emphasis and incitement to trigger emotional resonance in readers, creating a sense of collective identity and belonging. Pay attention to whether emotional words, expressions, and emotional emphasis appear in the text, as well as whether collective symbols and symbols are used to provoke emotional resonance.\n",
    "2. Topic focus: This type of text usually centers around a specific topic or event, providing extreme descriptions and evaluations. Pay attention to whether the text contains exaggerated, black-and-white, or absolutist language, as well as praise, admiration, or aggressive remarks towards specific groups or events.\n",
    "3. Group effect: This type of text often uses the group effect to convey information and trigger action. Pay attention to whether the text includes calls for collective action, methods of mobilizing participation, and characteristics that strengthen information transmission and motivate action through group identity and belonging.\n",
    "4. Context analysis: In addition to the text itself, it is important to consider the environment and background in which the text exists. Observing factors such as the platform on which the text is published, the author's identity, the target audience, and its connection to other relevant information can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the text's purpose and intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exaggerated Emotional Expression: These statements emphasize the enthusiasm and steadfast belief of the “Di Ba” members through exaggerated expressions and emotional extremity. Through such language, they convey support and pride for the activity to evoke emotional resonance and a sense of belonging among group members; Application of Group Psychology: These statements draw on principles of group psychology, understanding the extremity and simplicity of emotions within gathered group members. They leverage the characteristics of group psychology, using exaggerated language to attract and stimulate participation and support from group members; Persuasion and Communication Strategy: These statements adopt an exaggerated communication strategy when addressing an already “warmed-up” group. As group members are already full of enthusiasm and anticipation for the activity, the use of exaggerated language in communication emphasizes the importance and power of the event, further enhancing the motivation for participation among group members.\n",
    "\n",
    "These characteristics of the statements can be summarized as: emotional arousal, extreme exaggeration, mobilization for collective action, admiration and praise for the “Di Ba” group and the expedition event, the use of collective symbols and representations, and the emphasis on collective identity and a sense of belonging.  As Yan Changkun[<span id=\"fn2\">(2018,P66,67)</span>](#fn2-black)mentioned, the ubiquitous “Di Ba” expedition-style discourse reveals the fervor and explosive enthusiasm of group members. This aligns with the notion that when mobilizing an enthusiastic crowd, logical argumentation need not be considered rational or correct; instead, sensational and exaggerated language suffices. In conclusion, the suggestive, declarative, and exaggerated discourse strategies presented in the “Di Ba” style discourse, though appearing casual, aim to create a context of heightened collective enthusiasm.\n",

    "When the culture of a group aligns with the values and goals they advocate for, it creates a motivational mechanism that drives members to develop a multifaceted cultural identity and collective interaction within the “Diba” community. Through a unified mobilization foundation, “Diba” profoundly influenced the values and mindset of its members, thereby fostering enthusiasm and solidarity among followers to support the community's collective activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "On online platforms, the expression of nationalist sentiment has become a common phenomenon. By sharing symbols, behaviors, and connecting with like-minded individuals, people express their identification and emotional ties to their nation and ethnicity. This performance of identity politics is influenced by the interaction between individuals and external environments. During the \"Chou Tzu-yu incident,\" \"Diba\" fully leveraged the connectivity of the internet to engage in ranking and traffic redirection across platforms, mobilizing and recruiting participants through the construction of shared \"patriotic\" and \"nationalistic\" discourse. Although \"Diba expeditions\" appear organized, requiring participants to follow commands, adhere to specific timelines, maintain discipline, target designated objectives, and use fixed group templates, in reality, young people are influenced and mobilized by Diba's new style of discourse. This often turns expeditions into a festive, noisy game without the necessity for in-depth logical reasoning or argumentation, seeking instead a situation of heightened collective enthusiasm. In this mobilization process, celebrity-related memes help set the atmosphere by combining celebrities with nationalist sentiments, further reinforcing collective identity and the mobilizing effect, evoking emotional resonance among fans and enhancing their willingness to support and participate in collective actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, 'Diba expeditions' can be seen as a form of collective mobilization and public opinion guidance activity, leveraging the combined influence of symbols, discourse, and emotions to engage and garner the support of fans, thereby forming a polarized collective action force. This action imparts an image of legitimacy to online aggression under the guise of 'nationalism' and 'patriotism,' enabling it to gain broad acceptance and support within the group."
